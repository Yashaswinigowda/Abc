They all attach this into function (or object) and the difference is in the function invocation (see below).

CALL:
attaches this into function and executes the function immediately:

var person = {
  name: "James Smith",
  hello: function(thing) {
    console.log(this.name + " says hello " + thing);
  }
}

person.hello("world");  // output: "James Smith says hello world"
person.hello.call({ name: "Jim Smith" }, "world"); // output: "Jim Smith says hello world"
